reMaking Backbone More Like a Framework
-------------------------------------

Now while I strongly Don't recommend you use a library like a framework, some of you will anyways, and some of you will be forced to use Backbone.
If your going to use a library like a framework there are a few things to consider before you do so. 
There are also a few ways I recommend going about utelizing a library like Backbone as a framework.
Firstly you should pick a framework to model your library as a framework after, preferrably one you know well. 
In this case I have picked Angular.js as I have worked with it a lot and its also a very powerful framework.
