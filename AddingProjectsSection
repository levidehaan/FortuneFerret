Adding a projects section to the site
=====================================

I work on a lot of different projects for other companies/people and I also work on my own. 
I will be putting mostly projects that I work on in this area, but when it's ok to talk about them I'll add client projects here too.

What I want to hopefully create is a place where people can learn from my projects that are open in a contextual manner, such as my Docker Enterprise project where I hope to teach about writing enterprise level software as I learn more about it.
